What is the biggest complaint about Airbus A320's flight-by-wire system?
Lack of feedback compared to a mechanical linked flight control system
Lack of friction compared to fighter jet sticks
The side stick is too small
It fails very often
Lack of feedback compared to a mechanical linked flight control system
If the stick is mechanically linked to the flight control surfaces, the pilot will be able to feel the pressure on the stick because of air flow.

What two things do you use for flight control when you are using mechanical backup?
Rudder and manual pitch trim
Side stick and manual pitch trim
Side stick and rudder
Manual pitch trim and rudder trim

Where do you put the thrust levers when you want to activate auto throttle?
Idle position
At 30%
Flex thrust
Climb thrust
Climb thrust
1) You use flex thrust for take-off. 2) On an airbus, the throttle has no absolute correlation with the thrust that the engines generate.

When there is an engine fire, what do you do right after you push the fire push button?
Discharge the agents
Put the thrust lever of that engine to its idle position
Turn off the engine master switch
Apply some rudder trim
Discharge the agents
Look at the picture. There's a checklist on it.

If you are on a 3 degree glide slope, and your airspeed is 200 kts. What is your ideal V/S? Ignore the effect of the wind. 
About 500 ft/min
About 700 ft/min
About 1000 ft/min
About 1250 ft/min
About 1000 ft/min
Here's the trick. Multiply the airspeed number by 5 and you get the approximate vertical speed.
